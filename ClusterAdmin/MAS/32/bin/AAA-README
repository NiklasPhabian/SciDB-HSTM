The files in this directory aid the reloading of plugins being
developed for SciDB. These grew during the course of plugin
development for the DERECHOS project. Each file contains hardcoded
information such as directory locations and hostnames that would need
to be adapted.

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE THESE FILES FOR IDEAS AND CONSTRUCT
YOUR OWN SCRIPTS SPECIFIC FOR YOUR NEEDS.

The general usage of these scripts are as follows. They are to be
executed by user 'scidb.' Passwordless ssh/scp to cluster nodes is
assumed.

<code>
# optionally save existing plugins
./backup-plugins

# unload libraries and stop SciDB
#
# NOTE: Do not unload UDT library (i.e. hstm) while you have
# UDT items in the SciDB database! Remove all such UDTs first,
# then you can unload the UDT. Currently SciDB doesn't know
# what to do with the UDTs associated with missing plugins.
./unload-and-stop

# Copy the plugin from the development library to the SciDB
# plugin directory.
#
# NOTE: The name of the plugin shared-object library file must
# 'match' the name of the library to be loaded via query.
./update-libraries

# Start SciDB and load the new plugin (shared-object library)
./start-and-load
</code>

To start or stop SciDB without touching the libraries, you can try
the scripts of those names.


NOTE ON SCIDB OUTPUT: Currently the plugins generate a great deal of output on stdout
and stderr and also via the logging system. This output and logging
should be turned off or commented out.

NOTE: Our SciDB clusters are configured to share plugin, etc., directories.


OTHER FILES
